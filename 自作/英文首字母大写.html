    I am the only child in my family, so I get used to doing things by myself. Since I go to school, my teacher always gives us the homework, the problem is that we must finish in a group. At first, I was refused, because I knew I could do it by my own. But my teacher insisted, so I had to work with my group members. I started to find that I got many ideas from my group members and I felt so happy to work with them. Now I realize that teamwork is really good, it not only relieves my pressure, but also brings me happiness. The power of teamwork is infinite.
